# Jedi Task Joy
This is an app which going to help developers get more joy from doing things and forget procrastination. 


There is a studies of neuroscience behind this method. Basically you can do it on paper but it's not easy to follow. 
The idea in short is that you donâ€™t need to be crazy disciplined in order getting things done! 
# You just need to match what you like with what need to be done. 
I have tested this togethter with my technical friends, and we are sure this can help to get most of your life!
# Steps: 
1. You commit your "reward bank" (among rewards is something you enjoy or get most dephomine from: music, football match, sweets, socail media, money for new purchase etc.)
2. Create the list of tasks which are either important or seem big, or you think you don't really like this and want to pospone...
List those tasks based on priority of each. 
3. Below each of the tasks you've listed choose from rewards. 
4. As you finish the task do not forget to get reword. The list of reward should be listed at your account field and be "crossed" as you gain this (or kept as a saving account for some larger perchase like your next vacation, for instance)
